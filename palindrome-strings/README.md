# The code you provided is checking whether a given word is a palindrome or not. Here is an explanation for each line of code

```#include <bits/stdc++.h>:``` This line includes the necessary standard library header files to handle input/output and string operations.

```using namespace std;:``` This line allows us to use names from the standard library (e.g., cout, cin) without explicitly specifying the std:: namespace.

```int main():``` This line declares the main function, which is the entry point of the program.

```string word;```: This line declares a variable word of type string to store the word to be checked.

```cout<<"Enter a word to check for palindrome(input uppercase or lowercase): ";```: This line prints a message to prompt the user to enter a word.

```cin>>word;```: This line reads the user input and assigns it to the word variable.

```string revWord = word;```: This line creates a new string variable revWord and assigns it the value of word. This will be used to store the reversed version of the word.

```reverse(revWord.begin(), revWord.end());``` This line uses the reverse function from the ```<algorithm>``` library to reverse the characters in the revWord string.

```if (word == revWord) {```: This line checks if the original word is equal to the reversed word. If they are equal, it means the word is a palindrome.

If the condition is true, the following code is executed:
```cout<< "Yes, entered word is a palindrome!";```: This line prints a message indicating that the entered word is a palindrome.

After the previous if statement, we have another if statement:

```if (word != revWord) {:``` This line checks if the original word is not equal to the reversed word. If they are not equal, it means the word is not a palindrome.
If the condition is true, the following code is executed:
```cout<< "No, entered word is not a palindrome!";```: This line prints a message indicating that the entered word is not a palindrome.
```return 0;:``` This line ends the main function and returns a value of 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.

Overall, this code checks if a given word is a palindrome and prints either ```"Yes, entered word is a palindrome!"``` or "No, entered word is not a palindrome!" based on the result.
