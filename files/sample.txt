[Pre-Chorus]
Bright, a white light
If there'd be
Any glory in war
Let it rest
On men like him
(Dead men will never come back)

[Chorus]
Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to Hell and back

[Verse 2]
A man of the 15th
A man of Can Do
Friends fall around him
And yet he came through

Let them fall face down
If they must die
Making it easier
To say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Bright, a white light
If there'd be
Any glory in war
Let it rest
On men like him
(Who went to hell and came back)

[Chorus]
Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to hell and back
